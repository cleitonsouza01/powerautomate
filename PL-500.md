## Module 2: Record and Analyze Processes

### Process Advisor Overview
- Process advisor can provide valuable insights that can help organizations improve their operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and stay competitive in a rapidly changing business landscape.

- Process mining

	- Gain a deep understanding of your processes using event log files that you can get from your system of record.

- Task mining

	- Enables you to zoom-in to specific desktop tasks you might have discovered during your process mining analysis.

- Minit

	- Analyzes data from process mining.

	- The first step in designing an automation is to understand what you are automating.

### Where to get data for Process mining

Event logs and activity logs from your system of record that document when an event or activity occurs.

- For process mining to analyze the event log, the following fields are necessary:

	- Case ID

	- Activity Name

	- Start Timestamp

	- End Timestamp

- You can connect to the data using Power Query supported connectors.

### Process mining report produced

- The process mining report provides valuable insights into your processes.

### Process mining report summary

- The report summary provides an overview of the key metrics and insights.

### Process KPIs

- The report includes process KPIs such as cycle time, throughput, and more.

### Path frequency

- The path frequency chart shows the different paths that the process can take and their relative frequency.

### Average duration

- The average duration chart shows the average time it takes to complete each step in the process.

### Process map

- The process map provides a visual representation of the process, including the activities, their durations, and the flow between them.

### Variant DNA chart

- The variant DNA chart allows you to compare different end-to-end paths of your process and identify exactly where the paths differ.

### Task mining allows organizations to

- Gain insights into how they perform tasks

- Identify common mistakes made during task performance

- Pinpoint tasks that can be automated

### Recording

- The recording process involves launching the recorder in Power Automate Desktop, performing the actions you want to record, and then finishing the recording.

#### Recording tips

- Be methodical in your actions

- Wait for the red box to focus on the item before selecting it

- If there were any selections made by mistake, delete the action in the recorder screen

- If you record steps not intended to be a part of the process, delete the step using the trash icon

#### Prepare recording for analysis

- The recorded actions need to be grouped into larger activities to create a clear process map. Process advisor has the ability to automatically group similar actions into activities, or you can manually adjust the groupings.

#### Grouping tips

- Use existing activity names

- Look for patterns in the actions

- Consider the frequency of actions

- Think about dependencies between actions

- Use feedback from stakeholders

### Process Advisor Process map

- The process map provides a visual representation of the process, including the activities, their durations, and the flow between them.

### Application analytics


### Identify automation opportunities

- The application analytics provide insights into the applications and windows used during the process.

- The process map indicates automation opportunities with blue recommendation icons on the process activities.

## Module 3: Design Automations

### Designing Automations key steps:

- Discover the current process

- Evaluate automation options

- Design the automation of the process

### Identify possible inputs

- Determine the required files, resources, and input/output formats, and how they can be accessed (connectors or APIs).

### Leverage Process Advisor to learn about process

- If you have activity data, use process mining. If not, consider task mining or observing the user performing the process.

### Identify processes to automate

- Where users switch between applications

- Repetitive steps users perform

- Common errors or omissions in the overall process

### Evaluate automation options

- Is there a need for any new user interfaces to the process?

- Do you need to store state for the process?

- What runs locally for the user, and what can run in the cloud?

### Evaluate if Power Apps is part of your automation

- Manage the overall process

- Start a flow on demand from the automation

- Manage business exceptions

### Cloud flow or Desktop flow?

- Cloud Flows

	- Connector or API available for the app being automated

	- Doesn't need to interact with local machine resources

- Desktop Flows

	- Automate an app that has no API

	- Needs to interact with local machine resources

	- Needs to interact with the user during the automation execution

### Handle Business Exceptions

- Determine if a notification is enough or if a process is needed to handle the exception

- Determine what will be handled in the cloud flow vs. the desktop flow

### Handle system exceptions

- Flows have standard retry logic on actions

- Identify areas that might need additional error handling

- Evaluate the need for design changes to improve reliability

- Identify how your automations will communicate system errors to operations staff

### Evaluate possible reuse

- Look for steps that are repeated in the process

- Evaluate if steps could be reused in a desktop sub flow or cloud child flow

- Determine if logic from the application should be centralized into a flow

- Evaluate if resources already exist that could be reused

### Possible Solution

- A possible solution for automating a customer warranty registration process could involve:

- Power Pages for the customer interaction

- Dataverse for storing the registration data

- A cloud flow to receive the new registration and trigger a desktop flow

- The desktop flow to input the registration into the legacy Warranty Manager application
